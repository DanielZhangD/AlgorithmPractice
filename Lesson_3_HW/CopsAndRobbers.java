//The only time when a sequence is not possible is when the policeman guards the same place EVERY DAY
//Otherwise, there is a valid sequence to be found
//I.e get a list of impermissable values, assign those impermissable values in a way that works, then assign in any other way
//(impermissible = guarded)
//only count each guarded one by one
//then, shift each over by one
//you then assign each value in
//if you have a guarded one, put in a guarded one that is free
//if you have a repeat guarded day, put in the unguarded one (i.e. never has been guarded)
//you can also have a list of unguarded values.
